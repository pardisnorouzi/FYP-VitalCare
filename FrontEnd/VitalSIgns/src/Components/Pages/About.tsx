        <h1>About:</h1>
        The Vital Care is a final year project and it was born from a desire to improve healthcare access and empower patients,
        particularly those in rural areas. I recognized the challenges of overcrowded hospitals and the
        limitations of traditional monitoring methods for elderly patients. Vital Care offers a user-friendly
        and cost-effective solution for remote health monitoring, promoting patient autonomy and preventative care.<br/>
        I envision a future where Vital Care bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers, fostering a
        more efficient and patient-centered healthcare delivery system.
